# Publishing Your Repository to GitHub

## Step 1: Finish Your Current Commit
1. Enter a commit message in the editor (like "Add GitHub guide")
2. Save and close the editor to complete the commit

## Step 2: Publish to GitHub
1. Look at the bottom status bar in VS Code
2. Click on the cloud icon with an up arrow (or "Publish Branch")
3. Choose "Publish to GitHub public repository"
4. Enter repository name: `Fiqiefendiahmad.github.io`
5. Select "Public" repository
6. Click "OK" or "Publish"

## Step 3: If That Doesn't Work, Use Terminal
1. Open Terminal in VS Code: Terminal > New Terminal
2. First, create a repository on GitHub.com named `Fiqiefendiahmad.github.io`
3. Check if the remote already exists:
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```
   
4. If you see "origin" in the results, remove it first:
   ```
   git remote remove origin
   ```
   
5. Now add the remote repository correctly:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Fiqiefendiahmad/Fiqiefendiahmad.github.io.git
   ```
   
6. Push your code to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

7. **If you see "rejected" error message:**
   
   When you see this specific error:
   ```
   ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
   error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Fiqiefendiahmad/Fiqiefendiahmad.github.io.git'
   ```
   
   Follow these exact steps:
   
   ```
   # Step 1: Pull the remote repository content first (simplest approach)
   git pull --no-rebase origin main
   
   # There might be merge conflicts, if so, resolve them in VS Code
   # VS Code will show you conflicts with <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers
   # Edit the files to resolve conflicts, then save them
   
   # Step 2: After resolving any conflicts, commit the merge
   git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
   
   # Step 3: Now push your changes
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   Alternative solution (if you're sure the remote content can be overwritten):
   ```
   # Force push your local content (WARNING: This will delete any content on GitHub!)
   git push -f -u origin main
   ```
   Only use this force push option if you're certain there's nothing important on the GitHub repository that you don't have locally.

## Step 4: Setup GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
6. Click "Save"
7. Visit `https://fiqiefendiahmad.github.io` after a few minutes

## Troubleshooting
- If asked for credentials, use your GitHub username and password (or token)
- If "Publish Branch" is not visible, try View > Command Palette, then search for "Git: Push"
